# Angular-deployment-tutorial
AngularJS 1.x, Grunt + Heroku

**Purpose:** The purpose for writing this application is to spread knowledge among developers for tools and technologies. I am publishing my Youtube videos here.
Its best place to learn for free !!

## Setup and steps on macOS:

I will use the **$** to represent the mac terminal prompt and **< >** as placeholder for your project's name.

* Install Node.js to your system by downloading [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
* To check if you already have a version of node:
```
$ node -v
```
* Since [node package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm) comes with the node install, all you’ll have to do is to do is to make sure that it’s up-to-date:
```
$ npm install npm -g
```
```
$ npm install grunt-karma --save-dev
```
* To see what the scaffolded your-project-app looks like on your localhost, type:
```
$ grunt serve
```
* At this point, I would recommend that you spend some time looking through the **Gruntfile.js** in the **root of your project folder** to see all of the available tasks that you can type into your command line. For example, ```$ grunt test``` will run tests that you would write under the **test/spec** folder and ```$ grunt``` will minify (one of several tasks) a copied version of your files and place those files into a **dist** (distribution) folder. The advantage of having these automation task commands is that you can continuous build and test your Web App locally and deploy them quickly to check for matching functionality.

## Onto deployment

* Within your project folder:
```
$ npm install grunt-build-control --save-dev
```
* Then navigate to the [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control) Github page, and use those instructions to complete your **Gruntfile.js**. I will outline what I’ve used here.
* Paste the following into your **Gruntfile.js**.
```
grunt.loadNpmTasks(‘grunt-build-control’);
```
* Next, refer to the **Usage** section on the grunt-build-control Github page and copy the example tasks into your **Gruntfile.js**. Below is my **Gruntfile.js** at this step of the tutorial. Do note that you’ll have to insert this block of tasks and make sure that each task is separated by a comma. This means that the task preceding ```buildcontrol: {…}``` would require a comma. I've indicated the two places insert code with ```///\```.
```
'use strict';

module.exports = function (grunt) {

  grunt.loadNpmTasks(‘grunt-build-control’);      ///\<---INSERT HERE
  var pkg = require('./package.json');          ///\<---INSERT HERE

  // Time how long tasks take. Can help when optimizing build times
  require('time-grunt')(grunt);

  // Automatically load required Grunt tasks
  require('jit-grunt')(grunt, {
    useminPrepare: 'grunt-usemin',
    ngtemplates: 'grunt-angular-templates',
    cdnify: 'grunt-google-cdn'
  });

  // Configurable paths for the application
  var appConfig = {
    app: require('./bower.json').appPath || 'app',
    dist: 'dist'
  };

  // Define the configuration for all the tasks
  grunt.initConfig({

    // Project settings
    yeoman: appConfig,

    ...// I've hidden the code in-between for brevity

    // Run some tasks in parallel to speed up the build process
    concurrent: {
      ...// I've hidden the code in-between for brevity
      dist: [
        'copy:styles',
        'imagemin',
        'svgmin'
      ]
    },   ///\ Don't forget the comma here, the code below is what I've copied over from grunt buildcontrol

    buildcontrol: {
      options: {
        dir: 'dist',
        commit: true,
        push: true,
        message: 'Built %sourceName% from commit %sourceCommit% on branch %sourceBranch%'
      },
      pages: {
        options: {
          remote: 'git@github.com:example_user/example_webapp.git',
          branch: 'gh-pages'
        }
      },
      heroku: {
        options: {
          remote: 'git@heroku.com:example-heroku-webapp-1988.git',
          branch: 'master',
          tag: pkg.version
        }
      },
      local: {
        options: {
          remote: '../',
          branch: 'build'
        }
      }
    }, ///\ Don't forget the comma here. The grunt buildcontrol pasted code stops here.

    // Test settings
    karma: {
      unit: {
        configFile: 'test/karma.conf.js',
        singleRun: true
      }
    }
  });


  grunt.registerTask('serve', 'Compile then start a connect web server', function (target) {
    ...// I've hidden the code in-between for brevity
  });

  ...// I've hidden the code in-between for brevity
};

```
* You will notice that the code block that you’ve just added has remote: ```'git@github.com:example_webapp.git’``` as the filler repository. You will need to manually change the ```example_webapp.git``` to your remote repository name on Github. Here is mine:
```
'git@github.com:Angular-deployment-tutorial.git'
```
* Add, commit, and push your project using Git.
* To create a distribution folder of your entire project, run:
```
$ grunt build
```
* You will notice that a dist folder has been created and is listed on your **.ignore** file. This folder will not be pushed to Github.
* To publish this project to your Github’s gh-pages, run:
```
$ grunt buildcontrol:pages
```
* A **gh-pages** branch will be created for you inside the dist folder.
* Congrats, you can now visit your deployed Angular template App on
```
http://<your-github-page-name>.github.io/<your-project-repo-name>
```
* If you wish to deploy this template App to Heroku, there will be a few more steps.

## Deployment to Heroku

* [Install Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
* Log into Heroku from your project directory
```
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: you@example.com
Password (typing will be hidden):
Authentication successful.
```
* Create your Heroku App:
```
$ heroku create
Creating stark-fog-398... done, stack is cedar-14
http://stark-fog-398.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/stark-fog-398.git
Git remote heroku added
```
* In the example above, the App, ```stark-fog-398``` has been created on heroku. Your App will have a randomly generated name. Take this name and place it into your **Gruntfile.js**. Here is what I have:
```
heroku: {
        options: {
          remote: 'git@heroku.com:guarded-hamlet-26569.git', ///\INSERT App name
          branch: 'master',
          tag: pkg.version
        }
      },
```
* If you want to give your Heroku App a name, then type:
```
$ heroku create <your-project-app>
```
* Change into your dist directory and create the following files:
```
$ touch package.json server.js Procfile
```
* Copy over your the contents of your **package.json** file in your project root. Change the node versoin to **0.12.0** from **0.10.0**. Leave only the following:
```
{
  "name": "yourprojectapp",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=0.12.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "karma start test/karma.conf.js"
  }
}
```
* Inside the dist directory, install express:
```
$ npm install express --save
```
* Your **package.json** will now resemble this:
```
{
  "name": "yourprojectapp",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=0.12.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "karma start test/karma.conf.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.14.0"
  }
}
```
* Create a simple express server inside the dist directory. Here is what my server.js looks like:
```
var express = require('express');

var app = express();

app.use(express.static(__dirname));

var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(port);
console.log('listening on ' + port);
```
* Heroku requires a Procfile to start the express server. Here is what my Procfile looks like:
```
web: node server.js
```
* Git add and commit changes for dist directory and project root directory.
* Push to Heroku using Grunt from the project root directory
```
$ grunt buildcontrol:heroku
```
* If all goes well, then congrats! You are now deployed on both gh-pages and Heroku.
* Here is my final result [yourProjectApp](https://guarded-hamlet-26569.herokuapp.com/#/)
* From here, as you continue to develop your App, you will have to run ```grunt``` to repackage your dist folder. Note that your **Package.json**, **server.js**, and **Procfile** will be deleted in the process. Be sure to copy their contents to a separate file in the root directory before running ```grunt``` from your project root. You will also have to ```npm install express`` from the dist directory.
* With anything, there's probably a better way to automate using Grunt. If would like to add anything, feel free to make a pull request.

Thanks!
